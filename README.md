This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

This is proof-of-concept implementation of RAIDq.

RAIDqâ€”a new way of extending RAID-6 to allow more checksum disks. 

For example, RAIDq can
allow up to 92 + 4 disks if we seek maximum coding speed, while
164 + 4 disks if we need to support larger disk arrays.

### How do I get set up? ###

Requirement: G++ and machine with AVX-2 instruction set.
